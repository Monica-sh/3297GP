## Assumptions:
1. Location Search from Geodata Location Search API will always provide exactly one match.

2. When an infection is confirmed, the person is immediately isolated and will not attend any subsequent events until no longer infectious.

3. A person will never become reinfected after recovering from COVID-19. 

4. There will be no cases of asymptomatic infection.

5. Epidemiologists act in a disciplined way, and they will never create duplicate attendance of any case event.

## Limitation:
1. Cannot reflect the case/event change immediately to other users.

2. No case of asymptomatic infection.
